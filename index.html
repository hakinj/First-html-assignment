    <!--This is question 2-->
    <p> my name is Akinola Akinjide, I have always had interest in web development because i have always been 
    facinated about the web and how it was developed. The webpage has made it really easy for people to access
     and get information about everything and anything. i am really happy capacityBay has  given me this opportunity 
     to learn web development.
     I am very positive with the Good and sharp mind of the faculty teaching us here at capacityBay, 
     I will at the end of this program be able to challenge any problem concerning wed development. 
     I see myself in the next 5 years building sophisticated webpage and teach upcoming people we have the same
      drive toward the program as i do now. Thanks to capacityBay once again for the great priviledge and opportunity
    </p>
